# PasteSphere – A Developer Snippet & Paste Management Platform

PasteSphere is a professional, developer-focused platform designed to help you create, store, manage, and share text pastes securely. Whether you are dealing with code snippets, terminal commands, quick notes, or configuration files, PasteSphere provides a clean, minimal interface inspired by the best developer tools.

---

## Motivation / Why This Project Exists

Developers frequently deal with temporary snippets of code, reusable logic, system configurations, and terminal commands. While fully-fledged version control is great for entire projects, it's often too heavy for quick sharing or storing a single script. Sending code over messaging platforms breaks formatting, and existing paste tools are often cluttered with ads or lacking modern developer-first features.

PasteSphere solves this by offering a fast, clean, and organized space to save and retrieve your snippets locally, categorizing them via tags and favorites, making them instantly accessible and easily shareable.

## Key Features

- **Create Paste**: Add title, content, tags, visibility, and expiration.
- **Edit Paste**: Update your existing snippets at any time.
- **Delete Paste**: Remove pastes you no longer need.
- **View Paste**: Read-only view with syntax styled appearance.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copying for fast workflow.
- **Shareable Paste Link**: Native device sharing or clipboard copy for easy distribution.
- **Search Pastes**: Find snippets instantly by title or content.
- **Favorite Pastes**: Star your most important pastes for quick access.
- **Tags**: Organize snippets with tags like `javascript`, `config`, or `notes`.
- **Public / Private**: Keep sensitive configs private or share useful snippets with the community.
- **User Authentication**: Secure JWT-based registration and login.
- **Download as Text**: Save any paste directly as a `.txt` file.
- **Auto-save Drafts**: Never lose your progress while typing.
- **Expiration Options**: Set pastes to self-destruct after 1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, or 30 days.

## Tech Stack

PasteSphere is built using the **MERN** stack for a robust, scalable architecture.

**Frontend:**
- **React.js** (Bootstrapped with Vite)
- **React Router v6** (Client-side routing and protected routes)
- **Axios** (API requests and interceptors)
- **Vanilla CSS** (Custom CSS Variables, Dark theme design system)

**Backend:**
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js** (REST API framework)

**Database & Auth:**
- **MongoDB** (NoSQL Database)
- **Mongoose** (ODM for MongoDB scheduling and validation)
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** (Stateless Authentication)
- **Bcrypt.js** (Password hashing)

---

## Architecture Overview

PasteSphere follows a standard client-server architecture:
1. **Frontend (React)**: Handles the user interface, component state, form validation, and client-side routing. It stores the JWT token locally and attaches it to authenticated requests.
2. **Backend (Express API)**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for authentication and paste management. It contains middleware to verify tokens and optionally authenticate open endpoints (like viewing public pastes).
3. **Database (MongoDB)**: Stores `Users` and `Pastes` collections securely. Uses Mongoose for schema validation.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] **Syntax Highlighting**: Integrate `Prism.js` or `highlight.js` for automatic language detection and styling.
- [ ] **Real-time Collaboration**: Use WebSockets to allow multiple users to edit a scratchpad together.
- [ ] **Folder Organization**: Allow users to group pastes into custom folders alongside tags.
- [ ] **Code Editor Integration**: Implement `Monaco Editor` or `CodeMirror` instead of a standard textarea for authentic IDE features.
